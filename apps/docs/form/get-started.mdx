With Chaindesk's Forms, you can build custom forms that allows your users to submit tickets to your support team. You can set up the form to capture any relevant information that is specific to your application.

Getting started with Forms is easy.
We offer a fully hosted solution that requires no code, as well as low-code and advanced options for full customization.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Form">
    Go to the [Forms](https://app.chaindesk.ai/forms) page. Create a new Form
    and configure it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Fields to your Form">
Under the Fields tab, create fields for your form.
Each field can have a type, such as email, phone number, text, select, file upload, etc.

The fields will behave differently depending on the type you choose, and you can mark each type as required or not.

See the full list of types and their behavior in the [Form Fields](/widgets/form/fields) section.
